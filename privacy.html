    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 6, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications and related services published by <strong>Mughu</strong> and available via the Google Play Store (collectively, the "Apps"). The policy describes how Mughu ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use any of the Apps or visit our website at <a href="https://mughu.id">mughu.id</a>.</p>
  </header>

  <section id="summary">
    <h2>Quick summary</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Short version:</strong> We collect only the data necessary to operate and improve the Apps (for example: device identifiers, analytics, crash reports). We do not sell personal information. For questions or requests, contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@mughu.id">privacy@mughu.id</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="information-collected">
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>The categories below describe the typical information we may collect across our Apps. Each App may collect a subset of these categories depending on features and permissions.</p>

    <h3>1. Information you provide directly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Account or profile information if you create an account (e.g., name, email address).</li>
      <li>User-generated content you submit (for example, feedback, posts, or messages sent to support).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Automatic device & usage information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (such as advertising ID), device model, OS version, and language.</li>
      <li>App usage information (screens visited, features used, session length).</li>
      <li>Crash reports, diagnostics, and performance data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Location (optional)</h3>
    <p>Some Apps may request location permissions for specific features. We collect precise or approximate location only if you grant permission and only to provide the requested feature.</p>

    <h3>4. Third-party information</h3>
    <p>We may receive information from third-party services and integrations (for example, analytics or ad partners) if you interact with those features.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="how-we-use">
    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use information for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the Apps and features.</li>
      <li>Personalizing in-app content and settings.</li>
      <li>Analytics and diagnostics to understand usage and fix issues.</li>
      <li>Responding to support requests and communicating important notices.</li>
      <li>Complying with legal obligations and preventing abuse.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="legal-basis-eu">
    <h2>Legal basis for processing (EEA residents)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on one or more legal bases to process your personal data: your consent (where required), performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations, or our legitimate interests (for example, to improve the Apps). When we rely on legitimate interests, we balance those interests against your privacy rights.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="share-data">
    <h2>When and with whom we share data</h2>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> analytics, crash reporting, hosting, and email providers that process data on our behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising partners:</strong> only in Apps that show ads and only for the purposes disclosed in that App (see specific App disclosures).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> when required to comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell personal information for money.</strong> If an App’s practices differ (for example, if data is sold or shared in ways that trigger CCPA), those specifics will be disclosed in that App’s in-app disclosures and the Google Play Data Safety form.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="third-party">
    <h2>Third-party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>The Apps may use third-party SDKs and services such as analytics, crash reporting, payment processors, and ad networks. These third parties have their own privacy policies; we recommend reviewing their policies in addition to this one. Please check the specific App description and the Google Play listing for the exact third parties used by each App.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-retention">
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary to provide the Apps and their features, to comply with legal obligations, or to resolve disputes. Retention periods vary by data type—diagnostic logs may be retained for a limited diagnostic period, while account information is retained until you delete your account.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="security">
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information. However, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a security incident affects your data, we will follow applicable notification requirements.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="children">
    <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>The Apps are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children below that age. If we learn we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly. If you believe a child under the applicable age has provided personal information, contact us.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="your-rights">
    <h2>Your privacy rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, and data portability. To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mabudarin@gmail.com">privacy@mabudarin@gmail.com</a>. We may require verification before honoring certain requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="ccpa">
    <h2>California residents (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know, delete, and opt out of the sale of personal information. As noted above, Mughu does not sell personal information for money. To submit a request, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@mughu.id">privacy@mughu.id</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="international-transfer">
    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be processed and stored in countries other than your country of residence. When transferring personal information across borders, we use legal safeguards required by applicable law (for example, standard contractual clauses) where appropriate.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="links">
    <h2>Links to other sites and services</h2>
    <p>The Apps and the website may link to third-party sites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. Please read their privacy policies before using them.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="google-play-data-safety">
    <h2>Google Play Data safety & permissions</h2>
    <p>For each App we complete Google's Data Safety form in the Google Play Console and disclose required permissions. The permissions requested by an App are limited to what is necessary for its features (examples: location for map features, camera for photo features, storage to save files). Ensure that the information declared on Google Play matches what is described in this policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="changes">
    <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy with a revised effective date. Continued use of the Apps after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
